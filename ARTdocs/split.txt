blueprint.py

This file outlines the feature-based file splitting method applied to ARTinterface/.
The goal is to isolate functionality into manageable, independent files to minimize
unintended side effects when editing code.

Why Split by Feature?
- **Isolation**: Changing one feature (e.g., CLI logs) doesn’t break unrelated ones (e.g., chat).
- **Clarity**: Smaller files focus on specific tasks, easing debugging and maintenance.
- **Scalability**: Add new features as new files without bloating existing ones.
- **Trade-off**: More files and imports, but worth it for solo dev stability.

How It Works:
1. **Identify Features**: Break a class into logical chunks (e.g., GUI: CLI, status, chat).
2. **Core File**: Keep the class definition and minimal setup (e.g., `__init__`), call feature functions.
3. **Feature Files**: Move methods to separate files, passing `self` or necessary objects.
4. **Imports**: Use relative imports (e.g., `from .gui_core import ARTGui`) with `__init__.py`.
5. **State**: Share state via `self` or explicit arguments to maintain functionality.

Example - Splitting `gui.py`:
- Original: `class ARTGui` with `__init__`, `add_text`, etc.
- Split:
  - `gui_core.py`: `class ARTGui`, `__init__` calls `setup_cli(self)`, etc.
  - `gui_cli.py`: `setup_cli(gui)` for CLI widget.
  - `gui_chat.py`: `setup_chat(gui)`, `add_text(gui, text, tag)`.
  - Imports: `from .gui_core import ARTGui` in feature files.

Applying to Other Folders:
1. **Map Features**: List methods and group by purpose (e.g., `ARTcore/nano.py` → `nano_core.py`, `nano_calls.py`).
2. **Create Core**: Define the class, move minimal setup to `__init__`.
3. **Split Methods**: Move each feature to its own file, adjust calls to use passed objects.
4. **Fix Imports**: Update all references to new file names.
5. **Test**: Run and debug import/attribute errors iteratively.

Pitfalls:
- **Imports**: Ensure `__init__.py` exists; fix circular imports with forward references if needed.
- **State**: Don’t lose object references—pass what’s needed.
- **Overhead**: Balance file count vs. complexity—don’t split tiny files unless they grow.
